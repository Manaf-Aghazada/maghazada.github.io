        <p> Hi. I'm Manaf Aghazada. I was born in 2002 in Baku and lived in Yasamal until I was 5 years old. 
            Even though I had been witness many criminal accidents on that territory, I had lots of funny and enjoyable 
            moments. I have two elder sisters and our parents were gone to works, therefore, we were alone home mostly.
            For the reason there were lots of kidnapping, mom was lock the door everytime and hide key top of the shelf
            when she left us alone. But my brave sister jump from window and open the door for us to go outside and play
            with neightbours' children and when we saw that it was time for my mother to come home from work,
            we would enter the house and my sister would lock the door and enter the house through the window,
            and we would take her permission and drop her in the yard as if nothing had happened. But it all came out one day and it was because of our love for ice cream. One day when my mother came home
            she bought ice cream for us and when we saw it we ran at my mother and got caught like that.

    <h3 id="section-primary-school">Primary School</h3>
        <p>	When I was 5, we moved to Jeyrabatan and I started my primary education on there.
        At the same time I was going to music school to learn 	new skills such as playing tar, solfege, chorus, dancing.
        It could seem hard to do all those things at the same time for that year old
        kid, I did it. Actually, I didn't want to go there but by the force of my parents
        it had been 4 years that I go there. By those skills I were well known on my school.
        When it comes to my education, I was one of the excellent students. There were 5 of us that are competing
        for leadership.
        </p>
    <h3 id="section-high-school">High School</h3>
        <p>
        After I graduated from primary school, I spent my summer holiday to prepare for exam to be accepted to the high school
        on Sumgait. To be honest, at the beginnning, I didn't know that I will study there. My mom cheated me that it would be
        just for testing my knowledge, but I passed exam and then, my high school story started and I was graduated from that
        school in 2019. 
        </p>
    <h3 id="section-university">University</h3>
        <p>
            In 2019 I had been member of the best university in Azerbaijan. First year of my education was about learning such English
            skills that grammar, listening, speaking, reading and writing. There were 4 levels that I had passed. My group number was A3
            and I made new friendships. Unfortunately, at the middle of the academic year the whole world faced the corona virus and 
            our university switched from the traditional education system to the online system. Now after 3 year our classes are all offline
            and we can see our beautiful campus everyday. For now, my main goal is to graduate from the university with huge succesfull years.
